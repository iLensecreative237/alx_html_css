The main goals of the project were:

- Learn the basic structure of an HTML document (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>)
- Implement modern CSS styling using Flexbox
- Make the layout responsive to different screen sizes (including smartphones)
- Create clean and readable code using semantic HTML
- Apply styling rules while keeping layout strategies intact
- Understand and resolve Git and GitHub version control conflicts
 
Key Features

- Responsive Layout: Using Flexbox to build dynamic and adaptable layouts
- Header & Banner: Styled based on Figma wireframes, including a logo (unicode character)
 - Semantic HTML:Clean structure using tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>
- Modular Styling: CSS split into layout-related (base.css) and extra styles (styles.css)
- Version Control with Git: Learned to handle rebases, resolve merge conflicts, and use remote repositories efficiently
- Image Integration: Displayed using simple <img src="./images/6.png" alt=""> tags

- Git & GitHub:
  - Staging and committing files with git add and git commit
  - Pushing changes with git push and pulling updates with git pull
  - Fixing issues like:
    - fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
    - Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
    - Merge conflicts using VS Code's merge editor
